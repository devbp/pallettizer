In this project heuristic algorithm  for palletizing is used. The steps in the algorithm are:
1.First the all items are sorted according to the height.
2.The items with the same height are made layer i.e they are arranged in pallet.
3.All these layers are again sorted according to the area.
4.The layer with the biggest area is placed at the bottom.
5. All the remaining items are kept upon  the last layer then.
